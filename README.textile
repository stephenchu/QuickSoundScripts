h1. Quick Sound Scripts

This repo contains a few AppleScripts that can be mapped to Quicksilver keyboard shortcuts and then play a few selected sound clips of your collection (e.g. mp3) at a pre-set volume level. After the sound clip is played, your machine will revert to the same sound volume level before the clip was played.

You can now create your own sound-board just like the one "Jim Crammer":http://www.cnbc.com/id/18724672 uses!

h2. Compatiability

Tested on:
* OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard)
* @PlaySound.app@ (1.6.7).
* (Optionally) Quicksilver v3841.

h2. Installation

# Install @PlaySound.app@ (http://microcosmsoftware.com/playsound/).
# Puts the AppleScript files in your @~/Library/Scripts@ folder.
# Modify the scripts using @AppleScript Editor@ and point them to your sound clips.
# (Optionally) Map each sound to a keyboard shortcut:
## In Quicksilver, go to @Triggers@. For each sound clip, create a new @HotKey@ shortcut that does "@Run Script@ > _your.script.name_". In each script, you need to point the script to the location of your sound clips.
## To avoid mis-triggering sound clips, use more sophisticated key combinations, such as "_SHIFT_ + _^ ⌥ ⌘_ + X", where X is any characters A-Z.
